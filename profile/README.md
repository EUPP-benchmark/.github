The EUMETNET EUPP Benchmark
===========================

The Benchmark is an important deliverable of the [EUMETNET](https://www.eumetnet.eu) PostProcessing (PP) Module, aiming to provide high-quality benchmark datasets and infrastructures to compare the various methods used to [post-process](https://eupp-benchmark.github.io/pages/postprocessing-explained.html) the forecasts in National Meteorological Services. Indeed, the need to postprocess different types of forecasts is a challenges that all Weather Centers are currently facing, in order to provide consistent and reliable forecasts in a seamless fashion.

This GitHub organization is where our websites, codebases and datasets accessors are stored.
